## projectM - The most advanced open-source music visualizer, NOW INCLUDED IN LYRIC VIDEO STUDIO

**Check out the [Lyric Video Studio](https://lyricvideo.studio), powerful and advanced video editor, infused with ai. LVS also includes fragment shaders and
with projectM, you can create audio reactive backgrounds more easily!!!**

Forked from [https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm)

Main changes are in src/sdl-test-ui. Lyric Video Studio links dynamically (well, not links, but uses external exe) to that source. Feel free to use this repo if you need, back-link and credits to https://lyricvideo.studio and original project much appreciated
